# Let's Learn Assembly!
Hello, Friend.<br/>This repo is where I stash all the Assembly code I've learned through project-based learning—one of the best ways to master a new skill.  
If you're new to Assembly or just curious about low-level programming, these projects might help you get started. And before diving deeper into Assembly Language, I strongly recommend you to have basic foundations first:  
+ Computer Architecture  
+ Binary Computations  
+ Basic Programming Concepts
+ Data Structure and Algorithims  
Assembly is not that hard if you have strong foundation. So, I hope you to enjoy on your learnings and feel free to reach out if you need help.<br/>Have fun!

## Compilation
For compilation you will need : `nasm` & `ld` <br/>
Example compilation: <br/>
`nasm -f elf64 -o example.o example.asm` <br/>
`ld -o example example.o` <br/>
Execution: <br/>
`./example` <br/>

## Resources
I learnt a lot from the book [Low-Level Programming C, Assembly, and Program Execution on Intel® 64 Architecture](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-2403-8) and from the author's [repo.](https://github.com/Apress/low-level-programming)<br/>
