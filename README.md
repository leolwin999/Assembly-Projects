# Let's Learn Assembly!
Hello, Friend.<br/>This repo is where I stash all the Assembly code I've learned through project-based learningâ€”one of the best ways to master a new skill.  
If you're new to Assembly or just curious about low-level programming, these projects might help you get started. And before diving deeper into Assembly Language, I strongly recommend you to have basic foundations first:  
+ Computer Architecture  
+ Binary Computations  
+ Basic Programming Concepts
+ Data Structure and Algorithims  
Assembly is not that hard if you have strong foundation. So, I hope you to enjoy on your learnings and feel free to reach out if you need help!<br/>Have fun!
