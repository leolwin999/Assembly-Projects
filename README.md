# Let's Learn Assembly!
Hello, Friend.<br/>This repo is where I stash all the Assembly code I've learned through project-based learning, which is one of the best ways to master a new skill.  
If you're curious about low-level programming, these projects might help you get started. But please excuse me for messy codes as I'm also kinda noob in Assembly.  
And before diving deeper into Assembly Language, I strongly recommend you to have basic foundations first:  
- Computer Architecture
- Binary Computations
- Basic Programming Concepts
- Data Structure and Algorithims
  
Assembly is not that hard if you have strong foundation. So, I hope you to enjoy on your learnings and feel free to reach out if you need help.<br/>Happy Coding!

## Compilation
For compilation you will need : `nasm` & `ld` <br/>
Example compilation: <br/>
`nasm -f elf64 -o example.o example.asm` <br/>
`ld -o example example.o` <br/>
Execution: <br/>
`./example` <br/>

## Resources
I learnt a lot from the book [Low-Level Programming C, Assembly, and Program Execution on IntelÂ® 64 Architecture](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-2403-8) and from the author's [repo.](https://github.com/Apress/low-level-programming)<br/>
